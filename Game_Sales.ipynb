        "#Background and Prior Work\n",
        "Playing video games has become a big part of people's lives, people play video games to relax and take a break from stressful work. Based on a study from 2017, there are 2.2 billion active video gamers around the world, and around half of them spend money playing games (1). I believe that there are several factors that determine how much people spend on video games and my goal is to identify which one is the primary contributor to people's video game related spendings.\n",
        "Before purchasing a video game, most consumers look at various reviews, such as critic scores and user scores, to determine whether or not they should spend their hard earned money on that particular game. However, does one of these main sources of opinion hold more influence over consumers, or is there an additional factor that influences the choice to purchase a game? According to the Metacritic website, there have been many games where the critic scores and user scores varied greatly (2). The purpose of this project is to find out which attribute holds a greater influence over whether or not a game will sell well. However, besides these main attributes, like user score and critic score, there can be other factors that influence game sales, such as cultural differences, income levels, and impulsiveness. The site webpals (3) states that \"Asian players spend 1.5 times more on games than North American players\", these regional differences, whether it be cultural or attitudes towards gaming, could be a significant factor to if a game will sell well or not. \n",
        "However, while the majority of video game consumers only purchase a video game once, the same cannot be said regarding the select few (known as \"whales\" within the industry) who bring in the majority of the revenue within Free-To-Play business models (4). \n",

        "#Hypothesis\n",
        "Out of the attributes that will be examined, user score will most heavily impact video game sales. User scores may be gauged through Amazon reviews, Steam reviews, and user Metacritic scores. In comparison to critic scores, the quantity of user ratings vastly outnumber critics. Thus, casual consumers are  immediately exposed more to user reviews on the internet. The information that both critic scores and user scores may not be reliable, but due to the vast amount of critical reviews per title, interested consumers have the option to look for commonalities throughout them and find the average consensus to how the majority feel about the game. Additionally, many video game distributors have user reviews on each games' page, allowing for potential buyers to see what others think, which gives user ratings more influence over a person's choice to buy a game. \n",

        "#Data \n",
        "The ideal dataset for this question would be one that has variables for critic score, user score, age rating, sales both globally and regionally, sales by platform, price, the development budget, and the marketing budget. It would also have more specific variables that accounts for other factors, such as average mental wellness and household income of a region, the cultural differences of the region, and the target audience of the title. These additional pieces of information could probably be found in another dataset that is not necessarily related to video games. It would have observations for all game titles, and the data would be collected from the sales records of game developers and retailers. The data would be organized in a structured or semi-structured format and tidy format that makes it easy to manipulate and read. \n",
        "\n",
        "Since I cannot feasibly and reliably collect a vast amount of data to analyze, I will depend on databases for datasets that have already been collected and organized by other parties. This data will ideally contain no personal information in order to retain the anonymity of each person who submitted information along with having each person's personal consent for their data to be used for research purposes, making it ethically usable for the purposes of our research project. Since the data would already be available on a public database, I would not have to take measures to securely store the data since anybody can access it already.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Most likely, even with the ideal dataset, I will not have enough to definitively prove causation. At best, I will be able to form a strong correlation among these variables and video game sales."

        "When answering the question regarding which attribute (critic score, user score, rating) affects video game sales the most, privacy will likely be maintained as there should be no identifying information that can be linked to a specific person due to the dataset only providing scores and ratings. The datasets that will be used will be taken from public online databases, so our group does not need to securely store the datasets I use since it is already available for anybody to download and examine.\n",
        "\n",
        "This study can help identify exactly which attribute affects video game sales the most. Stakeholders in this question are players, game developers, critics, and retailers. Knowing what affects game sales could help players better identify which games are worth purchasing and for developers to know what to target to increase the likelihood of people purchasing their games. It could also affect the sales numbers of retailers, the reputation of critics, and both of the above factors for game developers.\n",
        "\n",
        "This question will give us insight into what the average consumer of video games look like, and what drives them to spend money on gaming purchases. \n",
        "\n",
        "The information gained from this study could be used for negative purposes, such as designing a game that is not fun to play, yet is very profitable, or for using predatory tactics to manipulate players into spending the most money. However, this is not a concern for the project because game developers are already conducting this kind of research internally. Releasing the results of this study would then be of benefit to players, who would be better informed against predatory tactics, while being of little benefit to those who intend to use said tactics and are already researching this topic anyway."

Since there are not too many missing values in the columns for Name, Year of Release, Genre, and Publisher, the rows with missing values from these columns are dropped. The columns for Critic Score, Critic Count, User Score, Developer, and Rating have very many missing values. From the first few rows of the dataset I can see that there are two titles with missing values in all of these columns, Super Mario Bros. and Pokemon Red/Blue. Both of these titles are quite old, released in 1985 and 1996 respectively, so it may be that the high number of missing values is because many video game titles were released before the Critic Score, Critic Count, etc. could be tracked. Therefore, I may try to find in which year did all of these attributes start being tracked, and limit the scope of the data accordingly. "

        "It's Wii Sports again, which doesn't fit the idea of 'smaller game', but it has such a low user count of 322. When considering that the user count is measured from user reviews on Metacritic, this starts to make more sense. Hardly anyone bothered to leave a review of Wii Sports on Metacritic because most people received the game for free along with their Wii console and thus are probably not very devoted to the game. I need to find another way to split 'larger' games from 'smaller' games. Lower sales numbers should indicate a smaller game."

        "The results were than in all cases, critic score had a stronger, positive relationship to global sales numbers than user score did, which is contrary to our hypothesis that user score would have a stronger impact on sales than critic score. User score tended to have a negative relationship of low magnitude to global sales numbers. However, for games that had less than 1 million sales, there was a very small positive relationship between user score and sales numbers. Furthermore, for games that had less than half a million sales, the positive correlation increased by about a factor of 10 when compared to games under 1 million sales. This supports our proposed explanation for why user score was negatively correlated with global sales numbers: games with small playerbases would have players that were more devoted, or perhaps more forgiving of flaws, while games with large playerbases might have players that are not as dedicated, or have higher expectations and  thus more critical of flaws.  \n",
        "\n",
        "As for explaining the difference between the critic score and user score correlations, critic score most likely has a stronger relationship to sales numbers because many players will decided whether or not to buy the game based on critic reviews. User score's smaller magnitude correlation with sales numbers could be explained by the fact that it does not exist until after a game is released, while critics are normally allowed to post their reviews a few days before release. Also, some players may wait to buy the game after seeing what other players think about the game first. Another reason for why user score had a smaller correlation with sales numbers could be because there are more user ratings and critic ratings. The larger size of this population can lead to more variability with the user ratings, which then leads to less of a correlation between user rating and global sales. "

For one, the dataset that I analyzed is from 2016 and prior, meaning that our analysis and predictor is possibly not accurate in relation to the games that are released and sold in the years up to current time. Especially with new consoles, such as the Nintendo Switch, and the ease of buying games through online stores, such as Steam, the relationship between user score, critic score, and global sales may have shifted in the past few years. Additionally, the number of releases of video games has progressively grown over the years with the overall quality of these games improving as well as the ease of purchasing digital copies of these games through online stores. Finally, our data is from Metacritic, which represents mostly English-speaking reviewers and can be missing data from well-known titles such as Super Mario Bros."

        "From our analysis on the relationship between critic score, user score, and global sales for video games, I concluded that critic score has a more influence over global sales than user score. With this information, video games producers and comapanies can design their game to be scored higher by critics since there is a significant positive relationship between global sales and critic scores. Additionally, due to the fact that critic scores come out before a game is actually released and being the only indication at the time about whether a game is good or not, developers can gauge if their game will likely be successful or not. All in all, our findings are nothing new to video game developers and that ultimately, games of good quality are responded well in both critic and user scores which drives sales in the end.  \n",
        "\n",
        "As for the comsumers of video games, from our study they can conclude that when shopping for a new game, in most cases high critic score correlates to high sales, and when a game has high sales it means it is a popular pick. Since there is a negative correlation between global sales and user score, potential buyers might be more wary since they may be disappointed by a popular game. Ergo by that logic consumers should lean more towards critic scores to find higher quality games, although like many other products consumers have copius amounts of variables when debating the purchase of a video game.   \n",
